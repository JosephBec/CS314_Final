## Areas Still Needing Coverage

Based on the coverage report, the following areas still need additional testing:

1. Lines 1158-1167: Likely related to error handling or edge cases
2. Lines 1243-1244: Possibly related to specific UI interactions
3. Lines 1298-1299: Possibly related to specific event handlers
4. Lines 1378-1443: Likely related to modal interactions or complex UI states
5. Lines 1465-1471: Possibly related to specific socket events
6. Lines 1499-1540: Likely related to cleanup functions or edge cases

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Mock More Complex Scenarios**:
   - Create tests that simulate more complex user interactions
   - Test edge cases and error handling scenarios

2. **Improve Socket Event Testing**:
   - Create more comprehensive tests for socket events
   - Test the interaction between multiple socket events

3. **Test UI State Changes**:
   - Create tests that verify UI state changes after user interactions
   - Test modal state changes and form submissions

4. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Create tests that simulate API errors
   - Verify that error messages are displayed correctly

## Running Tests

To run the tests and see the coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
```

This will run all tests and generate a coverage report that shows which lines of code are covered by tests and which are not.
